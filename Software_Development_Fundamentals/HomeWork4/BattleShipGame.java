/*
 * Battleship is usually a two-player game, where each player has a fleet and an ocean (hidden from the other player), 
 * and tries to be the first to sink the other player’s fleet. 
 * We will do just a solo version, where the computer places the ships, and the human attempts to sink them.
 * 
 * We’ll play this game on a 20x20 ocean. This is larger than the ocean in the traditional battleship game.  
 * In this game we will have one 8-square Battleship, one 7-square Battlecruiser, two 6-square Cruisers, two 5-square Light Cruisers, three 4-square Destroyers and four 3-square Submarines. 
 * Finally, unlike the traditional game, A player can shoot 5 times in each turn.
 * 
 * The computer places these 13 ships on the ocean in such a way that no ships are immediately adjacent to each other, 
 * either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
 * 
 * The human player does not know where the ships are. 
 * The initial display of the ocean shows a 20 by 20 array of locations, all the same.
 * 
 * The human player tries to hit the ships, by calling out a row and column number. 
 * The computer responds with one bit of information saying ”hit” or ”miss.” 
 * When a ship is hit but not sunk, the program does not provide any information about what kind of a ship was hit. 
 * However, when a ship is hit and sinks, the program prints out a message ”You just sank a ship-type.”
 * After each shot, the computer redisplays the ocean with the new information.
 *  
 * A ship is ”sunk” when every square of the ship has been hit. 
 * Thus, it takes 8 hits to sink a battleship but only 6 to sink a cruiser. 
 * The objective is to sink the fleet with as few shots as possible.
 * 
 * When all ships have been sunk, the program prints out a message that the game is over, and tells the user how many shots were required.
