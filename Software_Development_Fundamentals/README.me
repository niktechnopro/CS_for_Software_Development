## Software Development Fundamentals

### *Course Outline*
Week 1 - Java Basics: Variables, conditionals, and loops. Creating your first class in Java.
Week 2 - Testing and debugging: Testing code while you write it in order to ensure that fewer bugs make it all the way to a client. Become an effective debugger by using tools that are within Eclipse. Learn how to handle things like bad inputs/wrong file formats, etc. 
Week 3 - Intermediate Java: ArrayLists, encapsulation, static methods, and objects interacting with other objects.
Week 4 - Polymorphism (one name, many forms): Using overloaded methods, class inheritance, and interfaces to ensure the least amount of code gets repeated. Polymorphism is generally considered one of the core principles of object oriented programming.
