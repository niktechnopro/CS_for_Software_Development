## Algorithm Design and Analysis

### *Course Outline*

* ### *Week 1* - Algorithm design techniques – incremental and divide-and-conquer algorithms. Sorting and selection algorithms. Analysis of data structures – hash tables, heaps, and binary search trees
* ### *Week 2* - Algorithm design paradigms – Dynamic programming and greedy algorithms
* ### *Week 3* - Graphs and algorithms on graphs – graph traversals (depth-first and breadth-first search) and minimum spanning trees (Kruskal’s and Prim’s algorithms)
* ### *Week 4* - Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra’s and Floyd-Warshall’s algorithms) and NP-completeness
